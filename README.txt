All data used in this project was purely fiction.
All files needed to recreate the output is included in this repository. The pdf of the final report is included
along with the rmd file if you wish to look at the code.

An email with the following contents was sent from them:

Email from Gideon:
Hi again, great to know that you’re on board for this project.

The data team set something up for you to get the data. I’ve forwarded the details they sent, see below, all the descriptions of the data are there.

According to the legal team, it was better to only give you data for our current employees, so those are the only people in that data. Generally, we have a pretty good retention rate, though.

One of my People and Talent guys mentioned that we don’t collect data on ethnicity/race but that the team is considering it for EDI initiatives after a conference they went to, and he said it might also be related to salary. Once again, I don’t think anything like that will be an issue for us.

The board wants to hear that our hiring, promotion and salary processes are all fair, and based on talent and value to the company. They’re especially interested in the hiring pipeline as we’ve been trialling an AI service that screens applications and then invites candidates to submit a pre-recorded video that the system rates for relevant features. Candidate sare also invited to do a timed technical coding task and submit a writing sample and these are also assessed by the system. More on that in the docs, too.

Let me know if you have any questions, looking forward to the report on April 21.

Best,

Gideon Blake
Chief People Officer | Black Saber Software
